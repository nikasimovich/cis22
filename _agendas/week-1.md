### Friday, Lab
- [Zoom link](https://NewSchool.zoom.us/my/catangui)
- Introductions
- Talk about [hw0: Questionnaire](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/quv2xtqqfvwbnkgcz930c/Core-Interaction_-Lab-â€”-hw0.paper?dl=0&rlkey=8qh3d77o2er4f54f8keb74axd)

### Homework
- Finish the questionnaire.
- Set up your GitHub account and GitHub desktop app by following this [demo video](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8025633/video/502734712). Note that this demo uses Sublime, but I personally prefer to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- Create a basic home page for your GitHub account, making sure that your GitHub Pages site is set up properly. If I visit your site, I should be able to see it at a domain that looks similar to this: [http://seancaat.github.io](http://seancaat.github.io) (mine redirects to my personal site ðŸ™‚).

â€“ Brainstorm the subject matter for your cross platform storytelling project. Using Figma, sketch out three different ideas for your project. You can either sketch out 3 stories and the platforms youâ€™d use OR 1 story told in 3 different ways and the platforms youâ€™d use for each. Be ready to share your work on Tuesday.
