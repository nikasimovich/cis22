### Objectives
- Become aware of how you use the internet across platforms
- Tell a story, real or imaginary
- Explore platforms, their opportunities, and limitations
- Understand user flows
- Refresh your skills with HTML/CSS
- Set up on GitHub and get organized

### Project
Tell a story that begins with a web page you build and ends with a link to the starting point. Your story may be fiction or nonfiction. Traverse at least three platforms in between, leveraging the strengths of each to help your reader visualize the story. 

You could, for example, lead your reader to a TikTok video, then to an Amazon review, then to a LinkedIn profile, then to Instagram, and from Instagram to a dropped pin in Google maps. You can visit a platform more than once.
