### Project 4. Intx w/People
Input/Output

### Objectives
- To design for a specific user in mind
- To build an online tool
- To use Javascript to create unique outputs

### Introduction
The web is capable of formatting and rendering webpages. It is also capable of completing tasks by taking input of the users. For example:

A gif converter on images and videos before posting social media.

A pixel image painter

### Project
In this project, we’ll explore the boundaries of what a tool can be when it is made on the web. Create a set of rules which lead your website to generate content and form by an audience’s input. 

It is very important that you test and try to use the tool you make, as well as your friends and peers. Ask as many people as possible to engage with it throughout the design process. 

### Consider
- What/who is a user/audience?
- What is an online tool?
- What is your idea and how does it connect to your rule? 
- How open-ended is your tool/website?
-  Who is your audience and how do they interact with your site? 


### Requirements
- User can give an input to receive a unique output
- Site should take advantage of different screen sizes
- Must have an about section/page with design credit and any other information.
